Vector autoregressive Models for forecasting MSCIRUS on Gold , Crude and RUSGLB28TR

To study the factors influencing the resulting variable using CCF and
the Granger causality test. NB: do not analyze functionally
related variables in a pair (for example, DJIA and djia, or indices of American stocks
DJIA, SP500, Wilshire)
  
To construct an optimal
VAR
of variables, the expediency of including variables should be justified by the F-test.
If possible, impose restrictions on the significance of the model parameters and
check the auto-cross correlation of residuals (Hosking, LiMcLeod)
  
To construct an interval forecast of the resulting variable based on
the optimal VAR model (it is better to use the Monte Carlo method) and compare
the result with an interval forecast based on ARIMA.
  
Construct an IRF for the selected resulting variable and give their verbal
interpretation.
